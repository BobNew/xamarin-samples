Xamarin iOS & Android samples
=============================

**Xamarin.iOS** and **Xamarin.Android** samples.

The iOS samples in this repository are pre-Unified API; they build to the 32-bit old-style API that has been available since MonoTouch was first released in 2009.

For newer iOS samples using the [Unified (64-bit) API](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/macios/), see [Xamarin iOS samples](https://github.com/conceptdev/xamarin-ios-samples).

Cross-platform **Xamarin.Forms** samples are in the [Xamarin.Forms samples](https://github.com/conceptdev/xamarin-forms-samples) repository.
